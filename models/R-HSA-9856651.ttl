                "MITF-M is a transcriptional regulator that is critical for the establishment of melanocyte fate during embryogenesis. Key targets include the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the pigment compounds eumelanin and pheomelanin, as well as a number of structural components of the melanosome. In addition to regulating expression of genes involved in pigmentation, MITF has also been shown to play a role in the expression of genes involved in more diverse biological processes, including proliferation, survival, lysosome biogenesis, autophagy, metabolism, DNA damage, senescence and invasion (reviewed in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019; Mort et al, 2015; Zon and White, 2008, Cheli et al, 2010).<br>MITF is a basic helix loop helix leucine zipper (BHLH-ZIP)-containing protein and binds DNA as a dimer - either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with the related transcription factors TFEB, TFE3, and TFEC. TFEB and TFE3 are both widely expressed, but TFEC displays more restricted expression. In this pathway, for simplicity, MITF is shown binding DNA exclusively as a homodimer (reviewed in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019). <br>MITF and related BHLH protein family members bind to an E-box-like element with sequence CANNTG. Specificity of binding is determined both by the flanking nucleotides and by the identity of the two internal nucleotides of the E-box element. MITF binds preferentially to sequences CATGTG or CACGTG, and binds with less affinity to the CAGCTG sequences preferred by other BHLH proteins such as AP4 (Lowing et al, 1992; Bentley et al, 1994; Yavuzer and Goding, 1994). High-affinity MITF-binding sites also show an enrichment for flanking 5'T and 3'A, further distinguishing these sites from those preferentially bound by transcription factors such as MYC and MAX (Aksan and Goding, 1998; Fisher et al, 1993; Solomon et al, 1993; Hejna et al, 2018). Variants of high-affinity MITF binding sites present in the promoters of pigmentation genes are called M-boxes, to distinguish them from related E-box sequences (reviewed in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019). High-throughput ChIP-seq in the human melanoma cell line 501Mel identified MITF-binding at 5578 potential target genes, with 2771 showing promoter-proximal binding; only a subset of these genes were shown to be directly regulated by MITF, however (465; 240 down-regulated and 225 upregulated) (Strub et al, 2001; reviewed in Goding and Arnheiter, 2019). MITF-bound genes included those involved in melanocyte biogenesis as well as DNA replication, repair and mitosis (Strub et al, 2011)." ;
