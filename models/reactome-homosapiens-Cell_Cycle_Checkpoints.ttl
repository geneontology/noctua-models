DNA replication is carried out during a discrete temporal period known as the S (synthesis)-phase, and chromosome segregation occurs during a massive reorganization to cellular architecture at mitosis. Two gap-phases separate these major cell cycle events: G1 between mitosis and S-phase, and G2 between S-phase and mitosis. In the development of the human body, cells can exit the cell cycle for a period and enter a quiescent state known as G0, or terminally differentiate into cells that will not divide again, but undergo morphological development to carry out the wide variety of specialized functions of individual tissues.<p>A family of protein serine/threonine kinases known as the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) controls progression through the cell cycle. As the name suggests, the activity of the catalytic subunit is dependent on binding to a cyclin partner. The human genome encodes several cyclins and several CDKs, with their names largely derived from the order in which they were identified. The oscillation of cyclin abundance is one important mechanism by which these enzymes phosphorylate key substrates to promote events at the relevant time and place. Additional post-translational modifications and interactions with regulatory proteins ensure that CDK activity is precisely regulated, frequently confined to a narrow window of activity.<p>In addition, genome integrity in the cell cycle is maintained by the action of a number of signal transduction pathways, known as <b>cell cycle checkpoints</b>, which monitor the accuracy and completeness of DNA replication during S phase and the orderly chromosomal condensation, pairing and partition into daughter cells during mitosis.<p>Replication of telomeric DNA at the ends of human chromosomes and packaging of their centromeres into chromatin are two aspects of <b>chromosome maintenance</b> that are integral parts of the cell cycle.<p><b>Meiosis</b> is the specialized form of cell division that generates haploid gametes from diploid germ cells, associated with recombination (exchange of genetic material between chromosomal homologs)." ;

This remarkable fidelity is achieved by a number of signal transduction pathways, known as checkpoints, which monitor cell cycle progression ensuring an interdependency of S-phase and mitosis, the integrity of the genome and the fidelity of chromosome segregation.<p>Checkpoints are layers of control that act to delay CDK activation when defects in the division program occur. As the CDKs functioning at different points in the cell cycle are regulated by different means, the various checkpoints differ in the biochemical mechanisms by which they elicit their effect. However, all checkpoints share a common hierarchy of a sensor, signal transducers, and effectors that interact with the CDKs.<p>The stability of the genome in somatic cells contrasts to the almost universal genomic instability of tumor cells. There are a number of documented genetic lesions in checkpoint genes, or in cell cycle genes themselves, which result either directly in cancer or in a predisposition to certain cancer types. Indeed, restraint over cell cycle progression and failure to monitor genome integrity are likely prerequisites for the molecular evolution required for the development of a tumor. Perhaps most notable amongst these is the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in >50% of human tumors. Thus, the importance of the checkpoint pathways to human biology is clear." ;

As chromosome attachment to the spindle microtubules is a stochastic process, not all chromosomes achieve alignment at the spindle equator at the same time. It is therefore essential that even a single unaligned chromosome can prevent the onset of anaphase. The ability of the checkpoint to monitor the status of chromosome alignment is achieved by assigning checkpoint proteins to the kinetochore, a macromolecular complex that resides at centromeres of chromosomes that establishes connections with spindle microtubules. <P>The checkpoint proteins monitor, in an unknown way, the mechanical activities between kinetochore-associated proteins and microtubules. Defects in mechanical activities at kinetochores activate the resident checkpoint proteins to initiate a signal that is amplified throughout the cell that ultimately prevents the activation of the proteolytic process that is required for sister chromatid separation and the onset of anaphase. Kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes differ from those of aligned chromosomes in two ways. Kinetochores of aligned chromosomes are saturated with between 20 to 30 microtubules. In addition, poleward directed forces exerted at each sister kinetochore generates tension between them. Unaligned kinetochores on the other hand, are not saturated with microtubules and are not under tension. The mitotic checkpoint detects the presence of unattached kinetochores rather than monitoring for the presence of attached kinetochores. Consequently, unattached kinetochores emit an inhibitory signal that inhibits the biochemical events that are required to initiate the onset of anaphase. The mechanism by which this inhibitory signal is generated at unattached kinetochores has not precisely been determined but the signal is generated as a result of the lack of microtubule occupancy and kinetochore tension. A single unattached kinetochore is capable of preventing cells from exiting mitosis. The mitotic checkpoint provides a way for a localized defect to affect the global biochemical status of the cell. In principle, the signal that is generated at an unattached kinetochore diffuses throughout the cell to affect its target. There are currently two models for how this is achieved. One model is based on the observation that the Mad2 checkpoint protein binds and is rapidly released from unattached kinetochores. The kinetochore is believed to act as a catalyst that converts Mad2 into an inhibitory state that diffuses throughout the cell upon its release from the kinetochore. A second model proposes that the signal is amplified by a kinase cascade much like a conventional signal transduction pathway. This kinase cascade is believed to be comprised of the checkpoint kinases, hBUBR1, hBUB1, hMPS1." ;
