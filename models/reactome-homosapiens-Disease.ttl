                "The immune system is a complex network of the biological processes that provide defense mechanisms during infection or in response to an intrinsic danger signal. Compromised immune response may present itself as either overactivity or underactivity of the immune system leading to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes that can be categorized into four main groups - autoimmunity, immunodeficiency (ID) with a greater susceptibility to infectious diseases, hypersensitivity to compounds that are usually not harmful and malignancy. Several host conditions may cause the dysfunctional immunity. Among them are inherited and somatic mutations found in the components of immune signaling pathways. In addition to genetic defects, infection with pathogen such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or interaction of immune cells with immunosuppressive drugs result in non-genetic immunodeficiencies. Age-associated alterations in immunity may also contribute to pathogenesis of immunodeficiency .<p>The Reactome module represents selected defects of the immune system and provides a short description of their clinical phenotypes. The module also describes functional features of defective molecules by both providing a published source for experimental functional analysis data and linking to the corresponding normal process within the Reactome database." ;

                "Proteins with transporting functions can be roughly classified into 3 categories: ATP hydrolysis-coupled pumps, ion channels, and transporters. Pumps utilize the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to power the movement of substrates across the membrane against their electrochemical gradient. Channels in their open state can transfer substrates (ions or water) down their electrochemical gradient at an extremely high efficiency (up to 108 s-1). Transporters facilitate the movement of a specific substrate either against or with their concentration gradient at a lower speed (about 102 -104 s-1); as generally believed, conformational change of the transporter protein is involved in the transfer process. Diseases caused by defects in these transporter proteins are detailed in this section. Currently, disorders associated with ABC transporters are annotated here (Dean 2005)." ;

                "Defects in mammalian DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) are characterized by microsatellite instability and reduced fidelity during replication and repair steps. The MMR proteins interact with each other to execute steps within the mismatch repair pathway. Defective variants of these proteins are associated with nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The MutS proteins are thought to directly contact double-stranded DNA, scanning along the genomic DNA for mismatches analogous to a \"sliding clamp\" until they encounter a base pair containing a mismatch. The MutS proteins interact with multiple proteins including other MLH and MutL, the later have significant amino acid identify and structural similarity to the MLH proteins, as well as RPA, EXO1, RFC, possibly HMGB1, and other less well-characterized proteins. <br> <br> With respect to the mutator function, the MSH2/MutSaplha heterodimer is thought primarily to repair single-base substitutions and 1 bp insertiondeletion mutations, while MSH2/MutSbeta is thought primarily to repair 1-4 bp insertiondeletion mutations. The MLH and MutL heterodimer proteins interact with heterodimers of MutS proteins to help catalyze different functions. MLH1:MutLalpha is the primary complex that interacts with both MutS alpha and beta complex in mechanisms thought to be relevant to cancer prevention. Recent studies suggest that MLH1:MLH3 may also contributes to some of these processes as well, but in all mechanisms tested to a lesser degree than MLH1:PMS2." ;

                "Neurodegenerative diseases manifest as the progressive dysfunction and loss of neurons, which is frequently accompanied by formation of misfolded protein deposits in the brain. Classification of neurodegenerative diseases is based on clinical symptoms, which depend on the anatomical region affected by neuronal dysfunction, the identity of misfolded proteins and cellular and subcellular pathology.<br>In Alzheimers disease (AD), beta-amyloid protein (APP) deposits form in the extracellular space, where they can make plaques, while abnormally phosphorylated tau protein (MAPT) accumulates in neuronal cells.<br>Beside AD, neuronal and/or glial inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau are also found in Pick disease (PiD), neurofibrillary tangle-dementia (NFT), primary age-related tauopathy (PART), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) and globular glial tauopathies (GGT).<br>In prion disease, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, deposits of PrP protein are formed mostly in the extracellular and presynaptic space. PrP deposits in neuronal cell bodies are mainly confined to endosomes and lysosomes, which is attributed to neuronal uptake of pathological proteins and intercellular prion spreading.<br>In Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), deposits of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) are formed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies and neurites. In multiple system atrophy (MSA), deposits of alpha-synuclein form in the cytoplasm of glial cells (Papp-Lantos bodies).<br>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are characterized by ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP, commonly known as TDP-43), a protein that normally localizes to the nucleus. Pathological TDP-43 inclusions have been associated with the TDP-43 gene mutations, as well as mutations in several other genes, including C9orf72, GRN, VCP, SQSTM1, DCTN1 and OPTN. TDP-43 inclusions have also been reported in AD, DLB, hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.<br>FUS protein-positive inclusion bodies are found in familial ALS, caused by mutations in the FUS gene, as well as in a small subgroup of FTLD-related diseases. FUS-positive inclusions may be accompanied by FET protein-positive inclusions.<br>For a detailed review of molecular pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, please refer to Kovacs 2016.<br>Within this broad domain, the process by which APP-triggered deregulation of CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) triggers multiple neurodegenerative pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease has been annotated." ;

                "Biological processes are captured in Reactome by identifying the molecules (DNA, RNA, protein, small molecules) involved in them and describing the details of their interactions. From this molecular viewpoint, human disease pathways have three mechanistic causes: the inclusion of microbially-expressed proteins, altered functions of human proteins, or changed expression levels of otherwise functionally normal human proteins.<p>The first group encompasses the infectious diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis and HIV infection. The second group involves human proteins modified either by a mutation or by an abnormal post-translational event that produces an aberrant protein with a novel function. Examples include somatic mutations of EGFR and FGFR (epidermal and fibroblast growth factor receptor) genes, which encode constitutively active receptors that signal even in the absence of their ligands, or the somatic mutation of IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) that leads to an enzyme active on 2-oxoglutarate rather than isocitrate, or the abnormal protein aggregations of amyloidosis which lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's.<p>Infectious diseases are represented in Reactome as microbial-human protein interactions and the consequent events. The existence of variant proteins and their association with disease-specific biological processes is represented by inclusion of the modified protein in a new or variant reaction, an extension to the 'normal' pathway. Diseases which result from proteins performing their normal functions but at abnormal rates can also be captured, though less directly. Many mutant alleles encode proteins that retain their normal functions but have abnormal stabilities or catalytic efficiencies, leading to normal reactions that proceed to abnormal extents. The phenotypes of such diseases can be revealed when pathway annotations are combined with expression or rate data from other sources." ;

                "Diseases of glycosylation, usually referred to as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), are rare inherited disorders ascribing defects of nucleotide-sugar biosynthesis and transport, glycosyltransfer events and vesicular transport. Most CDGs cause neurological impairment ranging from severe psychomotor retardation to mild intellectual disability. Defects in N-glycosylation are the main cause of CDGs (Marquardt & Denecke 2003, Grunewald et al. 2002, Hennet 2012, Goreta et al. 2012) and can be identified by a characteristic abnormal isoelectric focusing profile of plasma transferrin (Jaeken et al. 1984, Stibler & Jaeken 1990). Disorders of O-glycosylation, glycosaminoglycan and glycolipid metabolism have recently been discovered and, together with N-glycosylation, represent the major pathways affected by glycan biosynthetic disorders (Freeze 2006, Jaeken 2011). As the number of these disorders has increased, nomenclature has been simplified so that now, the name of the mutant gene is followed by the abbreviation CDG (Jaeken et al. 2009). Effective therapies for most types of CDGs are so far not available (Thiel & Korner 2013)." ;
