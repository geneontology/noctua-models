These can be man-made (drugs, industrial chemicals) or natural (alkaloids, toxins from plants and animals). Uptake is usually via ingestion but inhalation and transdermal routes are also common.<p><p>The very nature of many chemicals that make them suitable for uptake by these routes, in other words their lipophilicty (favours fat solubility) is also the main reason organisms have developed mechanisms that convert them to hydrophilic (favours water solubility) compounds which are readily excreted via bile and urine. Otherwise, lipophilic chemicals would accumulate in the body and overwhelm defense mechanisms. This process is called <b><i>biotransformation</i></b> and is catalyzed by enzymes mainly in the liver of higher organisms but a number of other organs have considerable ability to process xenobiotica such as kidneys, gut and lungs. As well as xenobiotics, many endogenous compounds are commonly eliminated by this process.<p><p>This mechanism is of ancient origin and a major factor for its development in animals is plants. Most animals are plant eaters and thus are subject to a huge variety of chemical compounds which plants produce to stop themselves being eaten. This complex set of enzymes have several features which make them ideal for biotransformation;<p><p><i>(<b>1</b>) metabolites of the parent chemical are usually made more water soluble so it favours rapid excretion via bile and urine</i><p><p><i>(<b>2</b>) the enzymes possess broad and overlapping specificity to be able to deal with newly exposed chemicals</i><p><p><i>(<b>3</b>) metabolites of the parent generally don't have adverse biological effects.</i><p><p>In the real world however, all these criteria have exceptions. Many chemicals are transformed into reactive metabolites. In pharmacology, the metabolites of some parent drugs exert the desired pharmacological effect but in the case of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which can undergo epoxidation, it results in the formation of an electrophile which can attack proteins and DNA.<p><p>Metabolism of xenobiotica occurs in several steps called <i><b>Phase 1 (functionalization)</b></i> and <i><b>Phase 2 (conjugation)</b></i>. To improve water solubility, a functional group is added to or exposed on the chemical in one or more steps (Phase 1) to which hydrophilic conjugating species can be added (Phase 2). Functional groups can either be electrophilic (epoxides, carbonyl groups) or nucleophilic (hydroxyls, amino and sulfhydryl groups, carboxylic groups) <i>(see picture)</i>.<p><p>Once chemicals undergo functionalization, the electrophilic or nucleophilic species can be detrimental to biological systems. Electrophiles can react with electron-rich macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA by covalent interaction whilst nucleophiles have the potential to interact with biological receptors. That's why conjugation is so important as it mops up these potentially reactive species.<p><p>Many chemicals, when exposed to certain metabolizing enzymes can induce those enzymes, a process called <i><b>enzyme induction</b></i>. The effect of this is that these chemicals accelerate their own biotransformation and excretion. The reverse is also true where some chemicals cause enzyme inhibition. Some other factors that alter enzyme levels are sex, age and genetic predisposition. Between species, there can be considerable differences in biotransformation ability which is a problem faced by drug researchers interpreting toxicological results to humans." ;

The enzymes involved are a set of transferases which perform the transfer of the cofactor group to the substrate. The resultant conjugation results in greatly increasing the excretory potential of compounds. Although most conjugations result in pharmacological inactivation or detoxification, some can result in bioactivation. Most of the phase II enzymes are located in the cytosol except UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), which are microsomal. Phase II reactions are typically much faster than phase I reactions therefore the rate-limiting step for biotransformation of a compound is usually the phase I reaction.<br>Phase II metabolism can deal with all the products of phase I metabolism, be they reactive (Type I substrate) or unreactive/poorly active (Type II substrate) compounds. With the exception of glutathione, the conjugating species needs to be made chemically reactive after synthesis. The availability of the cofactor in the synthesis may be a rate-limiting factor in some phase II pathways as it may prevent the formation of enough conjugating species to deal with the substrate or it's metabolite. As many substrates and/or their metabolites are chemically reactive, their continued presence may lead to toxicity." ;

Glucuronidation is the major pathway in phase II metabolism and accounts for approximately 35% of drug conjugation. UGTs are microsomal membrane-bound and catalyze the transfer of a glucuronate group of uridine diphosphoglucuronate (UDPGA, a co-substrate) to the functional group of specific substrates. UDPGA is synthesized from glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). G1P is required for glycolysis and is present in high concentrations in the cell, making it is unlikely to be a limiting factor in UDPGA synthesis. UDP is added to G1P to form UDP-glucose which is then dehydrogenated to form UDPGA. The basic reaction is<p><b>UDP-Glucuronate + acceptor -> UDP + acceptor-beta-D-glucuronide</b></p>The effect of this conjugation is to confer polarity to the substrate which can then be easily excreted in urine or bile. Functional groups acted on include hydroxyl, carboxylate, amino and sulfate groups. There are 2 families of UGTs, UGT1 and UGT2 which are further sub-divided into 3 subfamilies, UGT1A, UGT2A and UGT2B. There are more than 26 different isozymes in humans, of which 18 are functional proteins. They are composed of 527-530 residues and have a molecular weight of 50-57KDa.<br>The UGT1 family comprises of 9 proteins (UGT1A1, 1A3-1A10) but only 5 have been isolated in humans. Example substrates which are glucuronidated are acetaminophen by UGT1A6 and bilirubin by UGT1A1. Members of the UGT2 subfamily are each encoded by their own genes, in contrast to UGT1As which are encoded at the UGT1 locus. Example substrates are morphine conjugation by UGT2B7 and androgenic steroid conjugation by UGT2B17.<br>Xenobiotics conjugated with glucuronic acid can be substrates for beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme common in gut microflora. This enzyme can release the parent or phase I metabolite which can be reabsorbed. It can then either re-exert it's original effects or be conjugated by glucuronic acid again. This cycle is called <i>enterohepatic circulation</i> and can delay the elimination of the xenobiotic." ;

One is localized to the Golgi apparatus and mediates the sulfonation of proteoglycans. The second, annotated here, is cytosolic and mediates the sulfonation of a diverse array of small molecules, increasing their solubilities in water and modifying their physiological functions. There are probably thirteen or more human cytosolic SULT enzymes; eleven of these have been purified and characterized enzymatically, and are annotated here (Blanchard et al. 2004; Gamage et al. 2005). These enzymes appear to be active as dimers. Their substrate specificities are typically broad, and not related in an obvious way to their structures; indeed, apparently orthologous human and rodent SULT enzymes can have different substrate specificities (Glatt 2000), and none has been exhaustively characterized. The substrates listed in the table and annotated here are a sample of the known ones, chosen to indicate the range of activity of these enzymes and to capture some of their known physiologically important targets. Absence of a small molecule - enzyme pair from the table, however, may only mean that it has not yet been studied." ;

This mutations was first seen as <i>slow acetylation</i> compared to the normal, <i>fast acetylation</i> of the antituberculosis drug isoniazid. Incidence of the slow acetylator phenotype is high in Middle Eastern populations (70%), average (50%) in Europeans, Americans and Australians and low in Asians (<25% in Chinese, Japanese and Koreans). N-acetylation and methylation pathways differ from other conjugation pathways in that they mask an amine with a nonionizable group so that the conjugates are less water soluble than the parent compound. However, certain N-acetlylations facilitate urinary excretion.<br>N-acetylation occurs in two sequential steps via a <i>ping-pong Bi-Bi mechanism</i>. In the first step, the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA is transferred to a cysteine residue in NAT, with consequent release of coenzyme-A. In the second step, the acetyl group is released from the acetylated NAT to the substrate, subsequently regenerating the enzyme." ;

The cofactor used in methylation conjugation is S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is the second most widely used enzyme substrate after ATP and is involved in a wide range of important biological processes. SAM is sythesized from methionine's reaction with ATP, catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). There are two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A, which encode for two homologous MAT catalytic subunits, 1 and 2.<br>During conjugation with nucleophilic substrates, the methyl group attached to the sulfonium ion of SAM is transferred to the substrate forming the conjugate. SAM, having lost the methyl moiety, is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH can be hydrolyzed to form adenosine and homocysteine. Homocysteine can either be converted to glutathione or methylated to form methionine, thus forming the starting point for SAM synthesis and completing the cycle.<br>Fuctional groups attacked are phenols, catechols, aliphatic and aromatic amines and sulfhydryl-containing groups. The enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the methyl group to these functional groups are the methyltransferases (MT). MTs are small, cytosolic, monomeric enzymes that utilize SAM as a methyl donor. There are many MTs but the best studied ones are named on the basis of their prototypical substrates: <i><b>COMT</b> (catechol O-methyltransferase)</i>, <i><b>TPMT</b> (thiopurine methyltransferase)</i>, <i><b>TMT</b> (thiol methyltransferase)</i>, <i><b>HNMT</b> (histamine N-methyltransferase)</i> and <i><b>NNMT</b> (nicotinamide N-methyltransferase)</i>. An example of each enzyme mentioned is given. In each case, a typical substrate for the enzyme is shown." ;

They can be found in the cytosol as well as being microsomal membrane-bound. Cytosolic GSTs are encoded by at least 5 gene families (alpha, mu, pi, theta and zeta GST) whereas membrane-bound enzymes are encoded by single genes. Soluble GSTs are homo- or hetero-dimeric enzymes (approximately 25KDa subunits) which can act on a wide range of endogenous and exogenous electrophiles. GSTs mediate conjugation using glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide synthesized from its precursor amino acids gamma-glutamate, cysteine and glycine. A generalized reaction is<p><b>RX + GSH -> HX + GSR</b></p>Glutathione conjugates are excreted in bile and converted to cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates in the intestine and kidneys. GSH is the major, low molecular weight, non-protein thiol synthesized <i>de novo</i> in mammalian cells. As well as taking part in conjugation reactions, GSH also has antioxidant ability and can metabolize endogenous and exogenous compounds. The nucleophilic GSH attacks the electrophilic substrate forming a thioether bond between the cysteine residue of GSH and the electrophile. The result is generally a less reactive and more water-soluble conjugate that can be easily excreted. In some cases, GSTs can activate compounds to reactive species such as certain haloalkanes and haloalkenes. Substrates for GSTs include epoxides, alkenes and compounds with electrophilic carbon, sulfur or nitrogen centres. There are two types of conjugation reaction with glutathione: <i>displacement reactions</i> where glutathione displaces an electron-withdrawing group and <i>addition reactions</i> where glutathione is added to activated double bond structures or strained ring systems." ;
