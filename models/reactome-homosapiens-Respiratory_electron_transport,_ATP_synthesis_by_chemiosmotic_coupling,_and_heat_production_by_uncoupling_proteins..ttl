                "Mitochondria are often described as the \"powerhouse\" of a cell as it is here that energy is largely released from the oxidation of food. Reducing equivalents generated from beta-oxidation of fatty acids and from the Krebs cycle enter the electron transport chain (also called the respiratory chain). During a series of redox reactions, electrons travel down the chain releasing their energy in controlled steps. These reactions drive the active transport of protons from the mitochondrial matrix , through the inner membrane to the intermembrane space. The respiratory chain consists of five main types of carrier; flavins, iron-sulfur centres, quinones, cytochromes (heme proteins) and copper. The two main reducing equivalents entering the respiratory chain are NADH and FADH2. NADH is linked through the NADH-specific dehydrogenase whereas FADH2 is reoxidised within succinate dehydrogenase and a ubiquinone reductase of the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Oxygen is the final acceptor of electrons and with protons, is converted to form water, the end product of aerobic cellular respiration. A proton electrochemical gradient (often called protonmotive force) is established across the inner membrane, with positive charge in the intermembrane space relative to the matrix. Protons driven by the proton-motive force, can enter ATP synthase thus returning to the mitochondrial matrix. ATP synthases use this exergonic flow to form ATP in the matrix, a process called chemiosmotic coupling. A by-product of this process is heat generation.<br><br>An antiport, ATP-ADP translocase, preferentially exports ATP from the matrix thereby maintaining a high ADP:ATP ratio in the matrix. The tight coupling of electron flow to ATP synthesis means oxygen consumption is dependent on ADP availability (termed respiratory control). High ADP (low ATP) increases electron flow thereby increasing oxygen consumption and low ADP (high ATP) decreases electron flow and thereby decreases oxygen consumption. There are many inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Most act by either blocking the flow of electrons (eg cyanide, carbon monoxide, rotenone) or uncoupling electron flow from ATP synthesis (eg dinitrophenol). Thermogenin is a natural protein found in brown fat. Newborn babies have a large amount of brown fat and the heat generated by thermogenin is an alternative to ATP synthesis (and thus electron flow only produces heat) and allows the maintenance of body temperature in newborns.<br><br>The electron transport chain is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and comprises some 80 proteins organized in four enzymatic complexes (I-IV). Complex V generates ATP but has no electron transfer activity. In addition to these 5 complexes, there are also two electron shuttle molecules; Coenzyme Q (also known as ubiquinone, CoQ) and Cytochrome c (Cytc). These two molecules shuttle electrons between the large complexes in the chain.<br><br>How many ATPs are generated by this process? Theoretically, for each glucose molecule, 32 ATPs can be produced. As electrons drop from NADH to oxygen in the chain, the number of protons pumped out and returning through ATP synthase can produce 2.5 ATPs per electron pair. For each pair donated by FADH2, only 1.5 ATPs can be formed. Twelve pairs of electrons are removed from each glucose molecule;<br><br>10 by NAD+ = 25 ATPs<br>2 by FADH2 = 3 ATPs.<br><br>Making a total of 28 ATPs. However, 2 ATPs are formed during the Krebs' cycle and 2 ATPs formed during glycolysis for each glucose molecule therefore making a total ATP yield of 32 ATPs. In reality, the energy from the respiratory chain is used for other processes (such as active transport of important ions and molecules) so under conditions of normal respiration, the actual ATP yield probably does not reach 32 ATPs.<br><br>The reducing equivalents that fuel the electron transport chain, namely NADH and FADH2, are produced by the Krebs cycle (TCA cycle) and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. At three steps in the Krebs cycle (isocitrate conversion to oxoglutarate; oxoglutarate conversion to succinyl-CoA; Malate conversion to oxaloacetate), a pair of electrons (2e-) are removed and transferred to NAD+, forming NADH and H+. At a single step, a pair of electrons are removed from succinate, reducing FAD to FADH2. From the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, one step in the process forms NADH and H+ and another step forms FADH2.<br><br>Cytoplasmic NADH, generated from glycolysis, has to be oxidized to reform NAD+, essential for glycolysis, otherwise glycolysis would cease to function. There is no carrier that transports NADH directly into the mitochondrial matrix and the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH so the cell uses two shuttle systems to move reducing equivalents into the mitochondrion and regenerate cytosolic NAD+. <br>The first is the glycerol phosphate shuttle, which uses electrons from cytosolic NADH to produce FADH2 within the inner membrane. These electrons then flow to Coenzyme Q. Complex I is bypassed so only 1.5 ATPs can be formed per NADH via this route. The overall balanced equation, summing all the reactions in this system, is<br><br>NADH (cytosol) + H+ (cytosol) + NAD+ (mito.) = NAD+ (cytosol) + NADH (mito.) + H+ (mito.)<br><br>The malate-aspartate shuttle uses the oxidation of malate to generate NADH in the mitochondrial matrix. This NADH can then be fed directly to complex I and thus can form 3 ATPs via the respiratory chain. The overall balanced equation is<br><br>NADH (cytosol) + H+ (cytosol) + FAD (inner memb.) = NAD+ (cytosol) + FADH2 (inner memb.)<br><br>Both of these shuttle systems regenerate cytosolic NAD+.<br><br>The entry point for NADH is complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and the entry point for FADH2 is Coenzyme Q. The input of electrons from fatty acid oxidation via ubiquinone is complicated and not shown in the diagram." ;

                "Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are members of the mitochondrial transport carrier family, and have been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. Physiological conditions include thermogenesis, fatty acid metabolism and protection against free radicals and ageing; pathological conditions include involvement in obesity, diabetes and degenerative, neurological and immunological diseases.<br><br>The UCPs share general structural features with the other mitochondrial transport carriers. They have a tripartite structure, consisting of three homologous sequence repeats of approximately 100 residues. The carriers also have a signature motif, which is repeated in all members of the family and in all three repeats. The transmembrane arrangement of UCPs is 6 alpha-helix regions (2 regions per repeat) spanning the lipid bilayer with the amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytosolic side. The crystal structure of one member of the family, the adenine nucleotide translocase, is known, and UCPs can be successfully folded into this structure to indicate their probable 3D arrangement (Pebay-Peyroula et al. 2003, Kunji 2004, Esteves & Brand 2005). The most studied member of the family, UCP1, catalyzes adaptive thermogenesis (i.e. heat generation) in mammalian brown adipose tissue. It does so by promoting a leak of protons through the mitochondrial inner membrane, which uncouples ATP production from substrate oxidation, leading to fast oxygen consumption and ultimately to heat production. The thermogenic activity of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue plays an important role when the organism needs extra heat, e.g. during cold weather conditions (for small rodents), the cold stress of birth or arousal from hibernation. UCP1 homologs have been found in lower vertebrates such as fish, where their role is unclear (Cannon & Nedergaard 2004, Jastroch et al. 2005). The proton conductance of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue is tightly controlled. It is strongly inhibited by physiological concentrations of purine nucleotides. This inhibition is overcome by fatty acids, which are released from intracellular triacylglycerol stores following adrenergic activation in response to cold or overfeeding. Other activators include superoxide, retinoic acid, the retinoid 4-[(E)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetra-methyl-2-naphtalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid (TTNPB) and reactive alkenals, such as hydroxynonenal. UCP2 and UCP3 have high amino acid sequence homology to UCP1 (59 and 57% amino-acid identity respectively). UCP2 has been identified in lung, spleen, pancreatic beta-cells and kidney, whereas UCP3 is found in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Homologs of UCP2 and UCP3 are found in marsupials, birds, fish and plants. Despite a low level of sequence homology with UCP1-3, UCP4 and UCP5 share their functional properties (Hoang et al. 2012). There is strong evidence that the regulated uncoupling caused by these proteins attenuates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, protects against cellular damage, and (in beta-cells) diminishes insulin secretion. There are also untested suggestions that their transport of fatty acids may be physiologically important (Brand & Esteves 2005, Esteves & Brand 2005, Krauss et al. 2005). The modest depolarization brought about by UCP activation is thought to diminish superoxide generation without significantly compromising ATP production, creating a protective, negative-feedback system that complements enzymatic defences against reactive oxygen species. There is some evidence that this mechanism is important in the etiology of Parkninson's Disease. Deletion of Park7 (DJ-1) decreased the abundance of Ucp5 and Ucp4 mRNA and compromised mitochondrial uncoupling in response to oxidant stress (Guzman et al. 2010). This may explain the unusual accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations with age in SNc dopaminergic neurons (Bender et al. 2006). These mutations, which are attributable to accumulated superoxide exposure, diminish mitochondrial competence and promote phenotypic decline, proteostatic impairments and death (Nicholls 2008). A number of models have been proposed for the molecular mechanism by which fatty acids lead to increased proton conductance by UCP1 in brown adipose tissue mitochondria, and presumably by the other UCPs as well. These are the \"fatty acid cycling\" model and the \"proton buffering\" model." ;

                "The re-entry of protons into the mitochondrial matrix through Complex V causes conformational changes which result in ATP synthesis. Complex V (ATP synthase) is composed of 3 parts; an F1 catalytic core (approx 5 subunits), an F0 membrane proton channel (approx 9 subunits) and two stalks linking F1 to F0. F1 contains three alpha subunits, three beta subunits, and one each of gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits. Each beta subunit contains an active site for ATP synthesis. F0 has at least 9 subunits (a-g, A6L and F6), with one copy each of subunits b, d and F6.<br>The mechanism of ATP synthesis by Complex V was predicted by Boyer et al in 1973: ADP and Pi bind to the enzyme resulting in a conformational change. ATP is then synthesized, still bound to the enzyme. Another change in the active site results in the release of free ATP into the matrix. The overall reaction is:<br>ADP + Pi + H+ + nH+ (intermemb. space) = ATP + H2O + nH+ (matrix)" ;
