                "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) was first described in the model organism E. coli in the early 1960s as a process whereby bulky base damage is enzymatically removed from DNA, facilitating the recovery of DNA synthesis and cell survival. Deficient NER processes have been identified from the cells of cancer-prone patients with different variants of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), and Cockayne's syndrome. The XP cells exhibit an ultraviolet radiation hypersensitivity that leads to a hypermutability response to UV, offering a direct connection between deficient NER, increased mutation rate, and cancer. While the NER pathway in prokaryotes is unique, the pathway utilized in yeast and higher eukaryotes is highly conserved.<BR>NER is involved in the repair of bulky adducts in DNA, such as UV-induced photo lesions (both 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPDs) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)), as well as chemical adducts formed from exposure to aflatoxin, benzopyrene and other genotoxic agents. Specific proteins have been identified that participate in base damage recognition, cleavage of the damaged strand on both sides of the lesion, and excision of the oligonucleotide bearing the lesion. Reparative DNA synthesis and ligation restore the strand to its original state.<BR>NER consists of two related pathways called global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The pathways differ in the way in which DNA damage is initially recognized, but the majority of the participating molecules are shared between these two branches of NER. GG-NER is transcription-independent, removing lesions from non-coding DNA strands, as well as coding DNA strands that are not being actively transcribed. TC-NER repairs damage in transcribed strands of active genes.<BR>Several of the proteins involved in NER are key components of the basal transcription complex TFIIH. An ubiquitin ligase complex composed of DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1 participates in both GG-NER and TC-NER, implying an important role of ubiquitination in NER regulation. The establishment of mutant mouse models for NER genes and other DNA repair-related genes has been useful in demonstrating the associations between NER defects and cancer.<BR>For past and recent reviews of nucleotide excision repair, please refer to Lindahl and Wood 1998, Friedberg et al. 2002, Christmann et al. 2003, Hanawalt and Spivak 2008, Marteijn et al. 2014)." ;
