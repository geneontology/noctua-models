                "Individual cells detect and respond to diverse external molecular and physical signals. Appropriate responses to these signals are essential for normal development, maintenance of homeostasis in mature tissues, and effective defensive responses to potentially noxious agents (Kultz 2005). It is convenient, if somewhat arbitrary, to distinguish responses to signals involved in development and homeostasis from ones involved in stress responses, and that classification is followed here, with <b>macroautophagy</b> and <b>responses to metal ions</b> classified as responses to normal external stimuli, while responses to hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, and heat, and the process of cellular senescence are classified as <b>stress responses</b>. Signaling cascades are integral components of all of these response mechanisms but because of their number and diversity, they are grouped in a separate signal transduction superpathway in Reactome." ;

                "In response to exposure to elevated temperature and certain other proteotoxic stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, free radicals) cells activate a number of cytoprotective mechanisms known collectively as \"heat shock response\". Major aspects of the heat shock response (HSR) are evolutionarily conserved events that allow cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress (Liu XD et al. 1997; Voellmy R & Boellmann F 2007; Shamovsky I & Nudler E 2008; Anckar J & Sistonen L 2011). The main hallmark of HSR is the dramatic alteration of the gene expression pattern. A diverse group of protein genes is induced by the exposure to temperatures 3-5 degrees higher than physiological. Functionally, most of these genes are molecular chaperones that ensure proper protein folding and quality control to maintain cell proteostasis.<p>At the same time, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha leads to the shutdown of the nascent polypeptide synthesis reducing the burden on the chaperone system that has to deal with the increased amount of misfolded and thermally denatured proteins (Duncan RF & Hershey JWB 1989; Sarkar A et al. 2002; Spriggs KA et al. 2010).<p>The induction of HS gene expression primarily occurs at the level of transcription and is mediated by heat shock transcription factor HSF1(Sarge KD et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1993). Human cells express five members of HSF protein family: HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSFX and HSFY. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat inducible gene expression (Zuo J et al. 1995; Akerfelt M et al. 2010). HSF2 is activated in response to certain developmental stimuli in addition to being co-activated with HSF1 to provide promoter-specific fine-tuning of the HS response by forming heterotrimers with HSF1 (Ostling P et al. 2007; Sandqvist A et al. 2009). HSF4 lacks the transcription activation domain and acts as a repressor of certain genes during HS (Nakai A et al. 1997; Tanabe M et al. 1999; Kim SA et al. 2012). Two additional family members HSFX and HSFY, which are located on the X and Y chromosomes respectively, remain to be characterized (Bhowmick BK et al. 2006; Shinka T et al. 2004; Kichine E et al. 2012).<p>Under normal conditions HSF1 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the form of an inactive monomer. The monomeric state of HSF1 is maintained by an intricate network of protein-protein interactions that include the association with HSP90 multichaperone complex, HSP70/HSP40 chaperone machinery, as well as intramolecular interaction of two conserved hydrophobic repeat regions. Monomeric HSF1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser303 and Ser 307 by (Zou J et al. 1998; Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Moromoto RI 1997; Guettouche T et al. 2005). This phosphorylation plays an essential role in ensuring cytoplasmic localization of at least a subpopulation of HSF1 molecules under normal conditions (Wang X et al. 2004).<p>Exposure to heat and other proteotoxic stimuli results in the release of HSF1 from the inhibitory complex with chaperones and its subsequent trimerization, which is promoted by its interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A1 (Baler R et al. 1993; Shamovsky I et al. 2006; Herbomel G et al 2013). The trimerization is believed to involve intermolecular interaction between hydrophobic repeats 1-3 leading to the formation of a triple coil structure. Additional stabilization of the HSF1 trimer is provided by the formation of intermolecular S-S bonds between Cys residues in the DNA binding domain (Lu M et al.2008). Trimeric HSF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus where it binds the specific sequence in the promoter of hsp genes (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994). The binding sequence for HSF1 (HSE, heat shock element) contains series of inverted repeats nGAAn in head-to-tail orientation, with at least three elements being required for the high affinity binding. Binding of the HSF1 trimer to the promoter is not sufficient to induce transcription of the gene (Cotto J et al. 1996). In order to do so, HSF1 needs to undergo inducible phosphorylation on specific Ser residues such as Ser230, Ser326. This phosphorylated form of HSF1 trimer is capable of increasing the promoter initiation rate. HSF1 bound to DNA promotes recruiting components of the transcription mediator complex and relieving promoter-proximal pause of RNA polymerase II through its interaction with TFIIH transcription factor (Yuan CX & Gurley WB 2000).<p>HSF1 activation is regulated in a precise and tight manner at multiple levels (Zuo J et al. 1995; Cotto J et al. 1996). This allows fast and robust activation of HS response to minimize proteotoxic effects of the stress. The exact set of HSF1 inducible genes is probably cell type specific. Moreover, cells in different pathophysiological states will display different but overlapping profile of HS inducible genes." ;

                "Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide (O2.-), peroxides (ROOR), singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and hydroxyl radical (OH.) are generated by cellular processes such as respiration (reviewed in Murphy 2009, Brand 2010) and redox enzymes and are required for signaling yet they are damaging due to their high reactivity (reviewed in Imlay 2008, Buettner 2011, Kavdia 2011, Birben et al. 2012, Ray et al. 2012). Aerobic cells have defenses that detoxify reactive oxygen species by converting them to less reactive products. Superoxide dismutases convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (reviewed in Fukai and Ushio-Fukai 2011). Catalase and peroxidases then convert hydrogen peroxide to water.<br>Humans contain 3 superoxide dismutases: SOD1 is located in the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space, SOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, and SOD3 is located in the extracellular region. Superoxide, a negative ion, is unable to easily cross membranes and tends to remain in the compartment where it was produced. Hydrogen peroxide, one of the products of superoxide dismutase, is able to diffuse across membranes and pass through aquaporin channels. In most cells the primary source of hydrogen peroxide is mitochondria and, once in the cytosol, hydrogen peroxide serves as a signaling molecule to regulate redox-sensitive proteins such as transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, and others (reviewed in Veal and Day 2011, Ray et al. 2012). Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to water by catalase, decomposed to water plus oxidized thioredoxin by peroxiredoxins, and decomposed to water plus oxidized glutathione by glutathione peroxidases (Presnell et al. 2013)." ;

                "Steroid hormone receptors (SHR) are transcription factors that become activated upon sensing steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, or estrogen (Escriva et al 2000; Griekspoor A et al. 2007; Eick GN & Thornton JW. 2011). Depending on SHR type and the presence of ligand, they show different subcellular localizations. Whereas both unliganded and liganded estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) are predominantly nuclear, unliganded glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptors (AR) are mostly located in the cytoplasm and completely translocate to the nucleus only after binding hormone (Htun H et al. 1999; Stenoien D et al. 2000; Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). The unliganded mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is partially cytoplasmic but can be found in nucleus in the ligand-bound or ligand-free form (Nishi M & Kawata M 2007). The progesterone receptor (PR) exists in two forms (PRA and PRB) with different ratios of nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of the unliganded receptor. In most cell contexts, the PRA isoform is a repressor of the shorter PRB isoform, and without hormone induction it is mostly located in the nucleus, whereas PRB distributes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Lim CS et al. 1999; Griekspoor A et al. 2007). In the absence of ligand, members of the steroid receptor family remain sequestered in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in the complex with proteins of HSP70/HSP90 chaperone machinery (Pratt WB & Dittmar KD1998). The highly dynamic ATP-dependent interactions of SHRs with HSP90 complexes regulate SHR cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and transcriptional activity (Echeverria PC & Picard D 2010). Understanding the mechanism of ATPase activity of HSP90 is mostly based on structural and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 complexes (Meyer P et al. 2003, 2004; Ali MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Prodromou C 2012). The ATPase cycle of human HSP90 is less well understood, however several studies suggest that the underlying enzymatic mechanisms and a set of conformational changes that accompany the ATPase cycle are highly similar in both species (Richter K et al. 2008; Vaughan CK et al. 2009). Nascent SHR proteins are chaperoned by HSP70 and HSP40 to HSP90 cycle via STIP1 (HOP) (and its TPR domains) (HernÃ¡ndez MP et al. 2002a,b; EcheverriaPC & Picard D 2010; Li J et al. 2011). The ATP-bound form of HSP90 leads to the displacement of STIP1 by immunophilins FKBP5 or FKBP4 resulting in conformational changes that allow efficient hormone binding (Li J et al. 2011). PTGES3 (p23) binds to HSP90 complex finally stabilizing it in the conformation with a high hormone binding affinity. After hydrolysis of ATP the hormone bound SHR is released from HSP90 complex. The cytosolic hormone-bound SHR can be transported to the nucleus by several import pathways such as the dynein-based nuclear transport along microtubules involving the transport of the entire HSP90 complex or nuclear localization signals (NLS)-mediated nuclear targeting by importins (Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). It is worth noting that GR-importin interactions can be ligand-dependent or independent (Freedman & Yamamoto 2004; Picard & Yamamoto 1987). In the nucleus ligand-activated SHR dimerizes, binds specific sequences in the DNA, called Hormone Responsive Elements (HRE), and recruits a number of coregulators that facilitate gene transcription. Nuclear localization is essential for SHRs to transactivate their target genes, but the same receptors also possess non-genomic functions in the cytoplasm.<p>The Reactome module describes the ATPase-driven conformational cycle of HSP90 that regulates ligand-dependent activation of SHRs." ;

                "Cellular senescence involves irreversible growth arrest accompanied by phenotypic changes such as enlarged morphology, reorganization of chromatin through formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), and changes in gene expression that result in secretion of a number of proteins that alter local tissue environment, known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).<br><br>Senescence is considered to be a cancer protective mechanism and is also involved in aging. Senescent cells accumulate in aged tissues (reviewed by Campisi 1997 and Lopez-Otin 2013), which may be due to an increased senescence rate and/or decrease in the rate of clearance of senescent cells. In a mouse model of accelerated aging, clearance of senescent cells delays the onset of age-related phenotypes (Baker et al. 2011).<p>Cellular senescence can be triggered by the aberrant activation of oncogenes or loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes, and this type of senescence is known as the oncogene-induced senescence, with RAS signaling-induced senescence being the best studied. Oxidative stress, which may or may not be caused by oncogenic RAS signaling, can also trigger senescence. Finally, the cellular senescence program can be initiated by DNA damage, which may be caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative stress, and by telomere shortening caused by replicative exhaustion which may be due to oncogenic signaling. The senescent phenotype was first reported by Hayflick and Moorhead in 1961, when they proposed replicative senescence as a mechanism responsible for the cessation of mitotic activity and morphological changes that occur in human somatic diploid cell strains as a consequence of serial passaging, preventing the continuous culture of untransformed cells-the Hayflick limit (Hayflick and Moorhead 1961).<p> Secreted proteins that constitute the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), also known as the senescence messaging secretome (SMS), include inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines, growth factors, shed cell surface molecules and survival factors. The SASP profile is not significantly affected by the type of senescence trigger or the cell type (Coppe et al. 2008), but the persistent DNA damage may be a deciding SASP initiator (Rodier et al. 2009). SASP components function in an autocrine manner, reinforcing the senescent phenotype (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008), and in the paracrine manner, where they may promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignancy in the nearby premalignant or malignant cells (Coppe et al. 2008).<p>Senescent cells may remain viable for years, such as senescent melanocytes of moles and nevi, or they can be removed by phagocytic cells. The standard marker for immunohistochemical detection of senescent cells is senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal), a lysosomal enzyme that is not required for senescence.<p>For reviews of this topic, please refer to Collado et al. 2007, Adams 2009, Kuilman et al. 2010. For a review of differential gene expression between senescent and immortalized cells, please refer to Fridman and Tainsky 2008." ;
